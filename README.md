<summary>Animation in CSS</summary>
<br>
  
> ### **`Animation in CSS`** :
- animation-fill-mode:
  - The animation-fill-mode property determines the styles applied to an element before and after the animation.
  - It can take the following values:
      - none: The default value. The element will not retain any styles from the animation before or after it runs.
      - forwards: The element will retain the styles of the last keyframe after the animation completes. This is useful if you want the final state of the animation to persist.
      - backwards: The element will apply the styles of the first keyframe before the animation starts. This can be useful if you want the initial state of the animation to be applied even before the animation begins.
      - both: Equivalent to setting both forwards and backwards. The element will retain styles from the first keyframe before the animation starts and from the last keyframe after it completes.

- animation-direction:
  - The animation-direction property determines the direction of the animation sequence, whether it proceeds forward, backward, or alternates between forward and backward.
  - It can take the following values:
      - normal: The animation runs forward from the beginning to the end.
      - reverse: The animation runs backward from the end to the beginning.
      - alternate: The animation alternates between running forward and backward. If the iteration count is even, it runs forward, and if it's odd, it runs backward.
      - alternate-reverse: Similar to alternate, but it starts by running backward.

## Node.js

<details>
<summary>Basics</summary>
<be>

> ### **`Basics`** :
Node REPL = read evaluate print loop <br>
JavaScript is synchronous / single threaded but in Web V8 engine is run in Web API's which make it asynchronous. <br>
Node(V8) has some reserved token so it separates them from words which it can't understand and pass them to Node.js APIs which then use libuv to interact with OS or Threads init.<br>
Node runs an EVENT LOOP for asynchronous operations by making Threads (from a Thread pool of 4(default) Threads) or use our OS to run operations in it's own call-stack (FIFO). This call-stack is called EVENT QUEUES.<br>


>Now EVENT LOOP has many Phases (here are only main Phases):
- Timer                 - setTimeout , setInterval
- I/O callbacks      - network and file operations and anything that doesn't fit in other phases
- setImmediate     - runs immediately after all I/O operations are done
- Close callbacks   - closing files networks


>Node.js is an Events-driven which follows an Observer pattern. 

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');

const MyEmitter = new EventEmitter();
MyEmitter.on('event' , ()=>{
	console.log('event occured');
})

// passing event to MyEmitter
MyEmitter.emit('event');

// ==============================================
// OUTPUT : event occured
// ==============================================
```

>Process which is an event emitter :

IN TERMINAL :
```javascript
node name_of_file.js something
```

IN name_of_file.js :
```javascript
process.argv.forEach((val , index)=>{
	console.log('${index}: ${val}');
});

// OUTPUT : 
// 0: node 
// 1: name_of_file.js
// 2: something
```

process.argv is an array that has elements as follows :
process.argv = [ process.execPath , name_of_js_file , arguments..... ]

So process.on is also an observer like MyEmitter.on (in above example) :
```javascript
process.on('exit' , (code)=>{
	console.log('Process exit event with an code: ', code);
})

// ====================================================
// OUTPUT : Process exit event with an code: 0
// ====================================================
```

```javascript
// ========================================================
// Method 1 : To securely only receive data (get end() automatically)
const { get } = require('https');

get('https://www.google.com' ,(res)=>{
	res.on('data' ,(chunk)=>{
		console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
	});
	res.on('end' , ()=>{
		console.log('NO more data');
	});
});

// ==========================================================
// Method 2 : To securely receive and send data
const { request } = require('https');
const req = request('https://www.google.com' ,(res)=>{
	res.on('data' ,(chunk)=>{
		console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
	});
	res.on('end' , ()=>{
		console.log('NO more data');
	});
})
req.end();

// ==========================================================
// Method 3 : To receive and send data
const { request } = require('http');
const req = request('http://www.google.com' ,(res)=>{
	res.on('data' ,(chunk)=>{
		console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
	});
	res.on('end' , ()=>{
		console.log('NO more data');
	});
})
req.end();
```

> When we import using require in a program the file/module is executed and then store in require.cache . 
> So if we do 'require' multiple time it returns the function which is exported and does not rerun it. 

>if we try to 'require' a folder, node automatically exports any file with name " index.js ".

>AXIOS :
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://www.google.com')
	.then((res)=>{
		console.log(res);
	})
	.catch((err)=>{
		console.log(err);
	});
```

> Stream and Buffers :

Stream is to wait for a minimum chunk of data (data received before minimum data is reached is stored in a BUFFER) and load it when reached and then wait for another chunk of data to load.

```javascript
const buffer = new Buffer.from('abcde');

buffer.write('codevolution');
console.log(buffer.toString());
console.log(buffer);
console.log(buffer.toJSON());

// ======================================================
// OUTPUT : 
// codev
// <Buffer 63 6f 64 65 76>
// { type: 'Buffer', data: [ 99, 111, 100, 101, 118 ] }
// ======================================================

// <Buffer 63 6f 64 65 76> : this is in hexadecimals
// { type: 'Buffer', data: [ 99, 111, 100, 101, 118 ] } : are UNICODE/ASCII code

```
> Connect Streams :
```javascript
fs.createReadStream('data.csv')
    .pipe(parser)
```
Like above, after reading a chunk of data received from a fs stream it is piped to csv parser to parse the data from csv to objects/json.
>MVC (Model - View - Controller) pattern :
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg/300px-MVC-Process.svg.png">

> ROUTER :
 
Routers are used to bundle a group of controllers who have same base endpoint . So this isolates this bundle from others and we can make router folder like controllers.

For Example :
```javascript
// =======================================================
// Here friendsController is an js file in controllers file 
// from which post and get friend fuction are exported.
// =======================================================

// without routes
app.post('/friends' , friendsController.postFriend);
app.get('/friends' , friendsController.getFriend);
app.get('/friends/:friendId' , friendsController.getFriend);

// =======================================================

// with routes
const friendRouter = express.Router();
app.use('/friends' , friendsRouter);

friendRouter.post('/' , friendsController.postFriend);
friendRouter.get('/' , friendsController.getFriend);
friendRouter.get('/:friendId' , friendsController.getFriend);

```

> we can know IP address of each request by `req.ip`


> NOTE : In LINUX and MAC path to a folder is /folder/file but in Windows path is \\folder\\file 
> Therefore use path 
```javascript
const path = require('path');

path.join(__dirname , '..' , public , 'file-name');

// ===========================================================
// To send a file for example .jpg use sendFile

res.sendFile( path.join(__dirname , '..' , public , 'file-name.jpg') );
```

>To send some static files like html css js we can use express.static() middleware.
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname , 'public' , 'index.html')));
```

```javascript
const requestData = { 
	[req.body.field]: req.body.value 
};
```
> In this code, we use square brackets `[]` around `req.body.field` to create a dynamic key based on the value of `req.body.field`, and then assign `req.body.value` as the value associated with that key. This will create a JSON object with the structure you desire.

## Ethical Hacking

<details>
<summary>Types</summary>
<br>

> ### **`Types`** :
[What Are The Five Steps Of Ethical Hacking? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/sudip_sg/what-are-the-five-steps-of-ethical-hacking-4hfe)
1) Social engineering : exploit human psychology, rather than technical security gaps to gain access to data and applications. They trick legitimate users into submitting their passwords or installing malicious software that grants them access to network machines and services.

2) Web application hacking : 
     Vulnerabilities that manipulate the application :
     - [Cross-Site Scripting](https://crashtest-security.com/cross-site-scripting-xss/)
     - [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://crashtest-security.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/)
     - [Insecure configuration](https://crashtest-security.com/disable-ssl-insecure-algorithm/)
     - [Injection attacks](https://crashtest-security.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-injection-attacks/)

3) Hacking wireless networks 

4) System hacking (hacking personal computer and servers)

 [Crashtest Security](https://crashtest-security.com/) offers a comprehensive suite of testing tools that help you identify threats within your application.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Methods</summary>
<br>

> ### **`Methods`** :
Reference ==> [Ethical hacking techniques - DEV Community](https://dev.to/snyk/ethical-hacking-techniques-3anh)
1) predictive analytics models is one of the main uses of AI and ML in cybersecurity. These models look for trends and abnormalities that can point to a potential security problem by analyzing data from a range of sources, including network traffic, user behaviour, and system logs.
2) Internet of Things testing's objective is to identify any security flaws in IoT hardware, communication protocols, and the networks they use by network mapping, device identification, firmware analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.
3) Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and pretexting
4) Red teaming involves simulating a real-world attack scenario to identify potential vulnerabilities and test an organization's incident response capabilities.
5) Bug bounty programs allow organizations to incentivize ethical hackers to identify potential vulnerabilities in their systems and report them in exchange for a reward.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>
<br>

> ### **`Steps`** :
1) Reconnaissance : hacker documents the organization’s request, finds valuable configuration and login information of the system, and probes the networks.
    Informations such as :
    - Naming conventions
    - Services on the network
    - Servers handling workloads in the network
    - IP Addresses
    - Names and Login credentials of users connected to the network
    - Physical location of target machine
    
2) Penetration testing : 
    - Network Mapping : This involves discovering the network topology, including host information, servers, routers, and firewalls within the host network. Once mapped, white hat hackers can visualize and strategize the next steps of the ethical hacking process.
    - Port Scanning : Ethical hackers use automated tools to identify any open ports on the network. This makes it an efficient mechanism to enumerate the services and live systems in a network, and how to establish a connection with these components.
    - Vulnerability Scanning : The use of automated tools to detect weaknesses that can be exploited to orchestrate attacks.
       Tools for scanning : 
       - SNMP Sweepers
       - Ping sweeps
       - Network mappers
       - Vulnerability scanners
       
3) Gaining Access : Attempting to send a malicious payload to the application through the network, an adjacent subnetwork, or physically using a connected computer.
    Tools to simulate attempted unauthorized access,
    - Buffer overflows
    - Phishing  
    - [Injection attacks](https://crashtest-security.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-injection-attacks/)
    - [XML External Entity processing](https://crashtest-security.com/xxe-processing/)
    - Using components with known vulnerabilities.
    
    If the attacks are successful, the hacker has control of the whole or part of the system and may simulate further attacks such as data [breaches](https://crashtest-security.com/prevent-breach-attacks/) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).
    
4) Maintaining Access :  involves processes used to ensure the hacker can access the application for future use. A white-hat hacker continuously exploits the system for further vulnerabilities and [escalates privileges](https://crashtest-security.com/privilege-escalation-guide/) to understand how much control attackers can gain once they get past security clearance. Some attackers may also try to hide their identity by removing any evidence of an attack and installing a backdoor for future access.
    
5) Clearing Tracks : To avoid any evidence that leads back to their malicious activity, hackers perform tasks that erase all traces of their actions.
    This includes : 
    - Uninstalling scripts/applications used to carry out attacks
    - Modifying registry values
    - Clearing logs
    - Deleting folders created during the attack
    For those hackers looking to maintain undetected access, they tend to hide their identity using techniques such as :
    - Tunneling
    - Stenography
