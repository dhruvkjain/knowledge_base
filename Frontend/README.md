**`ADVICE :`** You will definitely always feel underconfident about HTML CSS JS but after making some basic projects move on to React.js as you will learn them along the way,

<summary>Animation in CSS</summary>
<br>
  
> ### **`Animation in CSS`** :
- animation-fill-mode:
  - The animation-fill-mode property determines the styles applied to an element before and after the animation.
  - It can take the following values:
      - none: The default value. The element will not retain any styles from the animation before or after it runs.
      - forwards: The element will retain the styles of the last keyframe after the animation completes. This is useful if you want the final state of the animation to persist.
      - backwards: The element will apply the styles of the first keyframe before the animation starts. This can be useful if you want the initial state of the animation to be applied even before the animation begins.
      - both: Equivalent to setting both forwards and backwards. The element will retain styles from the first keyframe before the animation starts and from the last keyframe after it completes.

- animation-direction:
  - The animation-direction property determines the direction of the animation sequence, whether it proceeds forward, backward, or alternates between forward and backward.
  - It can take the following values:
      - normal: The animation runs forward from the beginning to the end.
      - reverse: The animation runs backward from the end to the beginning.
      - alternate: The animation alternates between running forward and backward. If the iteration count is even, it runs forward, and if it's odd, it runs backward.
      - alternate-reverse: Similar to alternate, but it starts by running backward.
